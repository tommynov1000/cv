        <p>I love the level of automation brought forth from computers. <br><br>
            The amount of work that can be done from your phone is astounding. I remember when I got my first flip phone
            and being absolutely floored with the fact that I no longer had to rely on my parents to help me communicate
            with my friends. This level of fascination led me down a path where I wanted to continue learning more about
            what I could do with the technology surrounding me. In middle and high school, I built multiple computers
            just for myself to play with because I thought it was hilarious to spam my friend with emails from my own
            mail server.<br><br>
            Eventually, my mischievous actions no longer became entertaining enough, so I made things more difficult for
            myself by building the entire infrastructure of friend's business. I was lucky enough to accomplish this
            right before I went to college to become a Nanoscientist. It was here that I learned I was not a fan of
            waiting around in a lab for test results. Although, not all was doom and gloom; as part of my curriculum,
            I was tasked with creating a programmable temperature control module using Java where I once again fell in
            love with computers, but from a different aspect: development. It was my first time experiencing the level
            of automation I could truly create by using algorithms, UI/UX methodologies and scripting. This newfound
            love led me towards the start of my career in IT.<br><br>
            Now, I am working towards becoming a DevOps engineer, where that same passion towards automation remains
            within me. I have an ever increasing amount of skills to learn, and yet more to practice. Every day brings
            new possibilities.<br>
